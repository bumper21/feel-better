      Feel Better is a mental health wellness site. <br>
      This application was made to assist those struggling with their mental health. It does this through simple mental health exercises, educational and motivational videos, and the ability to record thoughts and emotions through journal entries.

      <br>
      Often, struggling with depression and anxiety can limit a person's access to feelings
      such as hope, excitement, purpose, and passion as well as physical and mental energy. That is why the mental health exercises on this site are simple and can all be done from the comfort of your bed, couch, and home.
